# Linux Demo

 ![`Adamant running on Linux`](img/linux_cmd_line.png "Adamant running on Linux")

This demo will walk you through how to build and run an [Adamant](https://github.com/lasp/adamant) assembly inside the
Linux development environment. Running Adamant on Linux can aid in designing and troubleshooting many problems before deploying
on more demanding hardware, like the [Raspberry Pi Pico](../../pico/main/README.md).

## First Things First

 1. Make sure you have your Adamant Linux build [environment](../../../../docker/README.md) set up.
 2. Explore the [design](../doc/linux_example.pdf) of the Linux assembly.
 3. Make sure you are familiar with the Adamant [architecture design](https://github.com/lasp/adamant/blob/main/doc/architecture_description_document/architecture_description_document.pdf) and know where to find the [user guide](https://github.com/lasp/adamant/blob/main/doc/user_guide/user_guide.pdf).

## Building and running the Binary

From this directory in your Adamant Linux environment run:

```
$ redo run
```

This will compile the assembly and create the Linux binary at `build/bin/Linux/main.elf`. After compilation is complete
the binary will automatically be started in the terminal. You should begin to see the software output events periodically
as it runs, like:

```
Starting Linux demo... Use Ctrl+C to exit.
0000168822.872929071 - Ccsds_Socket_Interface_Instance.Socket_Connected (0x00000085) : (Ip_Address = [C0 A8 41 02], Port = 2003)
0000168823.861770448 - Counter_Instance.Sending_Value (0x00000091) : (Value = 1)
0000168825.862075414 - Counter_Instance.Sending_Value (0x00000091) : (Value = 2)
0000168827.862054941 - Counter_Instance.Sending_Value (0x00000091) : (Value = 3)

```
## Commanding and Telemetry with OpenC3 COSMOS

 ![`Commanding and Telemetry with OpenC3 COSMOS`](img/cosmos.png "Commanding and Telemetry with OpenC3 COSMOS")
 
To best interact with the Linux assembly, we need to use a ground system interface, such as OpenC3 COSMOS. To install COSMOS, navigate to an appropriate directory on your host machine and clone the COSMOS example project repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/openc3/cosmos-project.git
```

The COSMOS Docker container must be configured to use the same ports as Adamant. Edit this configuration at `cosmos-project/compose.yaml` and add the following entry to the `openc3-operator:` section:

```
    ports:
      - "2003:2003/tcp"
```

Start COSMOS by navigating to the `cosmos-project` directory and running:

```
./openc3.sh start
```

After the containers start, open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:2900`. You will be prompted to configure a password, and then presented with the COSMOS interface. Some modules may still be loading, but after a minute the interface should be complete. Navigate to `ADMIN CONSOLE` and uninstall the "openc3-cosmos-demo" plugin by selecting the `Delete Plugin` icon.

After installing and running COSMOS we need to build the Linux Example plugin configuration files. This will allow COSMOS to decode telemetry from the Linux assembly and properly format outgoing commands.

These files are autocoded by Adamant. From the `adamant_example/src/assembly/linux/main` directory in your Adamant environment run:

```
$ redo cosmos_config
```

This generates the plugin configuration file and its respective command and telemetry configurations in the `adamant_example/src/assembly/linux/build/cosmos/plugin/` directory.

OpenC3 COSMOS runs inside of its own Docker containers. The COSMOS example project provides the necessary tools and commands to create an interface plugin from our generated configuration files. Navigate to the `cosmos-project` directory and run:

```
$ ./openc3.sh cli generate plugin LINUX_EXAMPLE
```

This creates a new directory called `openc3-cosmos-linux-example`. Navigate to this directory and run:

```
$ ./../openc3.sh cli generate target LINUX_EXAMPLE
```

This creates the plugin directory structure as well as template configuration files that our generated configuration will replace. These files are located at:

```
cosmos-project/openc3-cosmos-linux-example/plugin.txt
cosmos-project/openc3-cosmos-linux-example/targets/LINUX_EXAMPLE/cmd_tlm/cmd.txt
cosmos-project/openc3-cosmos-linux-example/targets/LINUX_EXAMPLE/cmd_tlm/tlm.txt
```

Replace the contents of these text files with the contents of the corresponding files generated by Redo, located in the Adamant example project directory at:

```
adamant_example/src/assembly/linux/build/cosmos/plugin
```

The COSMOS plugin uses a default CRC protocol provided by COSMOS, but also needs a custom protocol to apply Adamant's command packet checksum correctly. The protocol file is located in the Adamant directory at:

```
adamant/gnd/cosmos/cmd_checksum.rb
```

And must be placed in the COSMOS plugin directory at:

```
cosmos-project/openc3-cosmos-linux-example/targets/LINUX_EXAMPLE/lib/cmd_checksum.rb
```

If the COSMOS and Adamant example project directories are adjacent, complete the configuration by running:

```
$ cp adamant_example/src/assembly/linux/build/cosmos/plugin/linux_example_ccsds_cosmos_commands.txt cosmos-project/openc3-cosmos-linux-example/targets/LINUX_EXAMPLE/cmd_tlm/cmd.txt
$ cp adamant_example/src/assembly/linux/build/cosmos/plugin/linux_example_ccsds_cosmos_telemetry.txt cosmos-project/openc3-cosmos-linux-example/targets/LINUX_EXAMPLE/cmd_tlm/tlm.txt
$ cp adamant_example/src/assembly/linux/build/cosmos/plugin/linux_example_ccsds_cosmos_plugin.txt cosmos-project/openc3-cosmos-linux-example/plugin.txt
$ cp adamant/gnd/cosmos/cmd_checksum.rb cosmos-project/openc3-cosmos-linux-example/targets/LINUX_EXAMPLE/lib/cmd_checksum.rb
```

The plugin can now be compiled. Navigate to the plugin directory at `openc3-cosmos-linux-example` and run:

```
$ ./../openc3.sh cli rake build VERSION=1.0.0
```

Select `Click to select plugin .gem file to install` and navigate to the compiled plugin gem file at `cosmos-project/openc3-cosmos-linux-example/openc3-cosmos-linux-example-1.0.0.gem` to install our generated plugin. The plugin is templated to allow changing of parameters such as ports, but the default values are already set to correspond with this project.

The plugin will be installed. Return to the Adamant Linux environment and start the Linux assembly by navigating to `adamant_example/src/assembly/linux/main` and running:

```
redo run
```

You should see events being received by COSMOS every two seconds from the Linux assembly over the socket in the `CmdTLMServer` panel.

With COSMOS running, here are some interesting things you can try:

 1. View events generated from the Linux assembly in the main panel.
 2. View telemetry from the Counter and Oscillator components by opening the `Telemetry Grapher` panel and selecting the corresponding packets and parameters.
 3. Send any command by selecting it in the `Command Sender` panel. Try sending a NOOP or changing the Oscillator frequencies.
 4. View the queue usage for each component by opening the `Packet Viewer` panel and selecting the corresponding packet.
 5. Send an interrupt to the running assembly by running `sh send_interrupt.sh` from a new SSH session within within the Linux environment. You should see the software respond by printing out `Interrupt received` with a time stamp in the terminal where `redo run` was started.

## Commanding and Telemetry with Hydra

 ![`Commanding and Telemetry with Hydra`](../../pico/main/img/hydra.jpg "Commanding and Telemetry with Hydra")

*Note that Hydra is not yet publicly available, but will be made so in the future. The instructions below serve as an example of how you could interact with this assembly with any ground system.*

To best interact with the Linux assembly, we need to use a ground system interface, such as Hydra. Before running
Hydra we need to build the Hydra configuration files. This will allow Hydra to decode telemetry from the Linux assembly and properly format
outgoing commands.

From this directory in your Adamant environment run:

```
$ redo hydra_config
```

You can also translate the produced Hydra configuration files to work with another ground system.

Hydra will listen on a network socket for connections on port 2003 of your host machine. The Linux assembly will periodically try to
connect to Hydra on this port.

With the Linux assembly running, see the previous section, open Hydra on your host machine and select your project directory as
`src/assembly/linux/main/hydra`.

Hydra will start up and you should see events being received every two seconds from the Linux assembly over the socket in the main panel.

With Hydra running, here are some interesting things you can try:

 1. View events generated from the Linux assembly in the main panel.
 2. View telemetry from the Counter and Oscillator components by opening the `Display Page -> custom -> plots` panel.
 3. Send any command by double clicking a line in the `View -> All Commands` panel. Try sending a NOOP or changing the Oscillator frequencies.
 4. View the queue usage for each component by opening the `Display Page -> linux_example -> linux_example_queue_monitor` panel.
 5. Send an interrupt to the running assembly by running `sh send_interrupt.sh` from a new SSH session within within the Linux environment. You should see the software respond by printing out `Interrupt received` with a time stamp in the terminal where `redo run` was started.

## What's Next

Now that you have Adamant running on Linux, it is time to make it your own. Try modifying or adding a component. Follow the tutorials
in the [user guide](https://github.com/lasp/adamant/blob/main/doc/user_guide/user_guide.pdf) to get going.
